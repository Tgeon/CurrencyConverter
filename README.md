# CurrencyConverter
This is a personal project I worked on to showcase a handful of Java skills that are useful in the real world.
The project uses a Real Time currency exchange rate API to convert foreign and domestic currency.
It is limited to a few major currencies, and does not currently have an GUI system implemented.
