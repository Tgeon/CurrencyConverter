This is a personal project I worked on to showcase a handful of Java skills that are useful in the real world.
The project uses a Real Time currency exchange rate API to convert foreign and domestic currency.
Could potentially be modified to use any API from any business or corporation, within the bounds that it is numerical and there is an exchange rate.
Created within Intellij, utilized Java and Maven in the creation process.
It is limited to a few major currencies, and does not currently have an GUI system implemented.

# About The Project
This project utilizes real time currency exchange rate data from https://www.freecurrencyapi.com.
Currently limited to 7 Major global currencies: EUR, USD, CAD, NZD, GBP, JPY, ZAR
A separate java class was created within the package to store the API Key separately, and may be exchanged with another variant of the API.
The recency of exchange rate data is dependent on the input API, which is accurate as of this project posting (2/7/2025).

# Contents
This project repository contains the source code for the project, all contained in a single package called Project1.
Contains all classes, packages, exceptions, and imports used in the project.
Contains git files created during generation of the repository.

# Installation
For users that may wish to test or further develop this code, it is acceptable to copy and paste the source code from the repository file. 

# Final Notes
This project was intended as a measurement of my current knowledge in Java, and is a showcase of my knowledge.
This project was also the first time I have incorporated APIs into code, and is the first project dependent on real world data.
